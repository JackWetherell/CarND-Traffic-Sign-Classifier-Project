# self-driving-car-traffic-signs-recognition

The goals of this project are the following: 
- Load a provided dataset of labelled German traffic signs.
- Explore, summarise and visualise the dataset. 
- Design, train and test a deep-learning model architecture in order to classify the traffic signs.
- Use the model to make predictions on new images, and analyse the softmax probabilities of the new images.
